Credit for the MKV to MP4 goes to http://vortex-5.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/mkv-to-mp4-conversion-for-ps3-playback.html which with some tweaks does what I need it to.

The following is required to get the libx264 codec installed on ubuntu to make it available in avconv
```bash
apt-get install libavcodec-extra-53
```
